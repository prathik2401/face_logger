# Face Logger

This project is a Face Logger, built with Python and the Django web framework. It focuses on detecting and logging faces, storing event data in an SQLite database, and includes features related to facial recognition.

## Features (Inferred)

*   **User Authentication**: Standard Django authentication system for managing users.
*   **Face Detection and Logging**: The system detects faces and logs related events with timestamps.
*   **Data Storage**: Uses SQLite (`db.sqlite3`) to store application data, including face-related information.
*   **Facial Data Management**: The presence of a `faces/` directory (ignored by Git) indicates capabilities for processing or storing facial data.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend**: Python, Django
*   **Database**: SQLite3
*   **Environment Management**: Likely uses a virtual environment and a `.env` file for configuration.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/prathik2401/face_logger.git
    cd face_logger
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    (Assuming a `requirements.txt` file exists or will be created)
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory. It might include variables like:
    ```env
    SECRET_KEY='your_django_secret_key'
    DEBUG=True
    # Add other environment-specific variables as needed
    ```

5.  **Apply database migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  **Create a superuser (for admin access):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

7.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The application should then be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Usage

*   Access the Django admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` with the superuser credentials.
*   Further usage details would depend on the specific functionalities implemented in the Django views and templates for face logging.
